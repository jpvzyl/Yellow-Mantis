> **What is TAM?**  
> TAM (Total Addressable Market) represents the total global revenue opportunity available if a product achieves 100% market share. It indicates the maximum potential size of the market a company is targeting. While no company captures 100% of TAM, it demonstrates the scale of opportunity and guides growth potential assessments. Even capturing 0.1% of a $44B TAM represents $44M in revenue potential.
