## Conclusion

The Yellow Mantis IP portfolio represents **R52.5M - R70M ZAR** in conservative valuation, with significant upside potential as:

1. Quantum computing matures (Quantum Bridge 10x potential)
2. Y-QA achieves market penetration
3. Robotics platform reaches production
4. Faces Group expands to new events/markets

The combination of production-proven code (Faces), revolutionary IP (Quantum Bridge), and AI-first architecture creates a unique technology portfolio that is difficult to replicate.
